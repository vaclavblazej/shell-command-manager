## TODOs

* fix over-escaping, e.g. in 'proot' test command
* improve search (not only one whole regex)
* help for arguments
* completion for arguments
* think of possible project configuration variables
* fix optional parameter load order
* refine the structure of modules
* release to pypi and get it tested by somebody else
* (seems hard) copy the command into command line instead of executing it

## Bugs from testing
